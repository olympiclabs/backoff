// LinearDelay defines a delay Algorithm imposing wait periods along a
// straight line using that old familiar formula you learned in high
// school, "y = mx + b" -- such that:
//
//   - y is the wait period duration for a given iteration -- or
//     the return value from the Wait method
//
//   - m is the slope of the line defined by the Slope field
//
//   - x is 1 less than the current iteration number passed to Wait
//
//   - b is the formula's "Y Intercept" (or rather, the first rerun
//     delay) as defined by the Base field.
//
// Take note that, while both Base and Slope can be zero (which results
// in no waiting periods whatsoever), and Slope *may* be negative, Base
// cannot. A negative Base value will always cause the OK method to return
// ErrNegativeDuration while a negative Slope will only force OK to return
// this error if our line ever crosses the X axis for any x value from
// 1 to Retry's number of iterations.
//
// For example, A LinearDelay with a Base of 100ms and a Slope of -25
// used with a Rerun of 5 iterations would be fine -- since the final
// waiting period would be 25ms. But 7 iterations would cause a problem
// since the final waiting period then be -25ms and, last I checked,
// time travel is not possible (yet).

	// Start defines the warmup time Rerun uses before its first call to a Func.

	// Base defines the waiting period that Rerun.Execute interleaves between its
	// first call to Func and the first rerun attempt. A negative Base value will
	// cause the OK method to return ErrNegativeDuration.
